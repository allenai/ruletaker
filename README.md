# ruletaker

This repo contains tools and utilities to generate datasets of theories and assertions meant to test the logical reasoning capabilities of a model. For details see the paper [Transformers as Soft Reasoners over Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05867).

## Theory Generator

### Inputs

1. Grammar: A grammar to generate theories, in PCFG format. E.g.:
```
Statement -> Fact | Rule
Fact -> Polarity '(' Attribute Entity ')' [0.3] | Polarity '(' Relation Entity  Entity ')' [0.7]
VFact -> Polarity '(' Attribute VEntity ')' [0.3] | Polarity '(' Relation VEntity Entity ')' [0.7]
VFacts -> '[' VFact ',' VFact ']' [0.5] | '[' VFact ']' [0.5]
Rule -> VFacts '->' VFact [1.0]
VEntity -> Entity [0.2] | Variable [0.8]
Entity -> 'cat' | 'dog'
Variable -> 'X'
Attribute -> 'red'
Relation -> 'chases' | 'eats'
Polarity -> '+' [0.5] | '-' [0.5]

```
In order for the theory generation to work properly, there are some key assumptions wrt what the grammar generates:

i.    A top-level statement can be a Fact or a Rule.
ii.   A Fact contains a predicate with one or more arguments in prefix notation, along with an associated polarity: + / - . Sample Facts:
          Cat is blue: `+ ( blue 'cat' )`
          Dog does not chase cat: `- ( chases dog cat)`
iii.  A Rule contains an antecedant and a consequent and takes the form: <antecedant> -> <consequent>. The antecedant is one or more Facts. The consequent is a single fact.       Sample Rule:
          If something is blue then it is sad: `+ (blue X) -> + (sad X)`
iv.   The entities can represent constants or variables in the grammar.
  
The theory generator needs to meaningfully associate the grammar nonterminals with the entities (constants and variables) and predicates. This mapping is specified via a config file which is described below.

2. Config: A config file in JSON format that contains some hyperparameter values for the theory generator. E.g.
```
{
  "theory": {
    "num_examples": 200, # The total number of examples (theories) that we want in the dataset.
    
    # Config for each type of top-level statement that will be in the theory.
    "statement_types_per_example": [ {
        # This means that in each example (theory) there will be between 1 and 16 statements that are Facts.
        # (A number randomly chosen in the interval [1, 16].
        "start_symbol": "Fact",
        "num_statements_range": [1, 16] 
      },
      {
        # This means that in each example (theory) there will be between 1 and 8 statements that are Rules.
        # (A number randomly chosen in the interval [1, 8].
        "start_symbol": "Rule",
        "num_statements_range": [1, 8]
      }
    ],
    "theorem_prover": {
      # Specifies the grammar nonterminals that map to predicates, variables and constants, respectively.
      "predicate_nonterminals": ["Attribute", "Relation"],
      "variable_nonterminals": ["Variable"],
      "constant_nonterminals": ["Entity"]
    } 
  },
  "assertion": {
    # The assertion to prove, given the theory. Each example in the dataset contains: a theory, an assertion,
    # and a label obtained by running the theory through a theorem proving engine.
    "start_symbol": "Fact"
  }
}
```

### Outputs
The tool can provide the output theories in three forms. A user may choose any/all of these.
1. A CSV file containing the generated theories and assertions in English.
   File format:
<theory English statements>, <assertion English statement>, <truth label>
   Sample output:
  ```Cat is blue. If X is blue then X is red.,Cat is blue.,True```   
2. A CSV file containing the generated theories and assertions as a logic program in the format expected by the theorem prover used, along with a truth label.
  File format:
<logic program>, <truth label>.
  Sample output:
  ```"1.0::blue('cat').
      1.0::red(X) :- blue(X).
      query(blue('cat')).",True```
3. A CSV file containing the theories and assertions directly as generated by expanding the grammar nonterminals. Here statements take logical forms in prefix notation, along with a truth label. The statements generated from the grammar are expected to be of the form: <polarity> ( <predicate> <argument1> <argument2> ... )
  File format:
<theory statement logical forms>, <assertion logical form>, truth label>.
  Sample output:
  ```+ ( blue X ) -> + ( red X ) + ( blue 'cat' ),(+ blue('cat')),True```

### Running the theory generator

To run the theory generator, first create a python environment with the necessary dependencies-

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then use the following command line to run the theory generator. Currently we are using Problog as the underlying theorem proving engine. That is the recommended engine to use.

NOTE:
If you are running on MacOS, you may run into this issue where the PySDD install is not recognized and once you try to run the program (below), you get an error like:
```
"The SDD library is not available. Please install the PySDD package."
problog.errors.InstallError: The SDD library is not available. Please install the PySDD package..
```
To get around this, run the following to ensure that PySDD is installed properly with dependency on the right version of `wheel` and other dependencies. This should fix the issue:
```
pip install -vvv --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-binary :all: --no-deps pysdd
```

```
python rule_generator.py --grammar <grammar_cfg_file_path> --config-json <theory_config_json_file_path> --op-theory-english <theory_in_english_op_file_path> --op-theory-program <theory_as_a logic_program_op_file_path> --op-theory-logical-form <theory_in_generic_prefix_notation_op_file_path> --theorem-prover <problog|pydatalog>
```

E.g.:
```
python rule_generator.py --grammar grammars_and_config/grammars/ruletaker_grammar_theory1.txt --config-json grammars_and_config/config/ruletaker_theory_generator_config_theory1.json  --op-theory-english ruletaker_theory1_english.csv --op-theory-program ruletaker_theory1_problog_program.csv --op-theory-logical-form ruletaker_theory1_lf.csv --theorem-prover problog
```

Once this completes, you should see a message that looks like:
```Generated 1000 examples.
  No. with True label: 432
  No. with False label: 568```
